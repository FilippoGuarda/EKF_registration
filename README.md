# Extended Kalman Filter for differential drives

This is a toy algorithm for performing Kalman filtering on the registration of an object observed from an Autonomous Mobile Robot camera.

## Results:
To test the python code, open the python directory `$ cd python` and then run the example code `$ python3 main.py`.
This package only depends on two libraries: `numpy` and `pyplot`, make sure they are both installed by using `pip3 install numpy pyplot`
